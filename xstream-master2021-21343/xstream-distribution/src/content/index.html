  <body>

    <p>XStream is a simple library to serialize objects to XML and back again.</p>

    <h1 id="features">Features</h1>

    <ul>
        <li><b>Ease of use.</b> A high level facade is supplied that simplifies common use cases.</li>
        <li><b>No mappings required.</b> Most objects can be serialized without need for specifying mappings.</li>
        <li><b>Performance.</b> Speed and low memory footprint are a crucial part of the design, making it suitable for
        large object graphs or systems with high message throughput.</li>
        <li><b>Clean XML.</b> No information is duplicated that can be obtained via reflection. This results
        in XML that is easier to read for humans and more compact than native Java serialization.</li>
        <li><b>Requires no modifications to objects.</b> Serializes internal fields, including private and
        final. Supports non-public and inner classes. Classes are not required to have default constructor.</li>
        <li><b>Full object graph support.</b> Duplicate references encountered in the object-model will
        be maintained. Supports circular references.</li>
        <li><b>Integrates with other XML APIs.</b> By implementing an interface, XStream can serialize
        directly to/from any tree structure (not just XML).</li>
        <li><b>Customizable conversion strategies.</b> Strategies can be registered allowing customization of how
        particular types are represented as XML.</li>
        <li><b>Security framework.</b> Fine-control about the unmarshalled types to prevent security issues with
        manipulated input.</li>
        <li><b>Error messages.</b> When an exception occurs due to malformed XML, detailed diagnostics are provided
        to help isolate and fix the problem.</li>
        <li><b>Alternative output format.</b> The modular design allows other output formats. XStream ships currently
        with JSON support and morphing.</li>
    </ul>

    <h1 id="use-cases">Typical Uses</h1>

    <ul>
        <li><b>Transport</b></li>
        <li><b>Persistence</b></li>
        <li><b>Configuration</b></li>
        <li><b>Unit Tests</b></li>
    </ul>

    <h1 id="limitations">Known Limitations</h1>

    <p>If using the enhanced mode, XStream can re-instantiate classes that do not have a default constructor. 
    However, if using a different JVM like an old JRockit version, a JDK 1.4 or you have restrictions because of a 
    SecurityManager, a default constructor is required.</p>

    <p>The enhanced mode is also necessary to restore final fields for any JDK &lt; 1.5. This implies deserialization of
    instances of an inner class.</p>

    <p>Auto-detection of annotations may cause race conditions. Preprocessing annotations is safe though.</p>
